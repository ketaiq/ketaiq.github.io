abstract = {The landscape of software engineering has dramatically changed. The recent advances in AI, the new opportunities of quantum computing, and the new challenges of sustainability and cyber security upset the software engineering research prospective. The 2030 SE-Roadmap special issue of ACM TOSEM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology gives a 360° view of the research challenges of the 30ties with a thorough editorial, four roadmap papers from the ACM TOSEM editorial board, and over 30 peer-reviewed papers from the research community.This paper previews the main content of the 2030 roadmap special issue with a report from the 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap workshop, co-located with ACM SIGSOFT FSE Foundations of Software engineering on July 15th and 16th, 2024 in Porto de Galinhas, Brazil, that spotlighted the software engineering research horizon to feed ideas into the ACM TOSEM special issue. The paper discusses the new challenges to software engineering that emerged in the SE2030 workshop: AI for software engineering, software engineering by and for humans, sustainable software engineering, automatic programming, cyber security, validation and verification, and quantum software engineering.},
