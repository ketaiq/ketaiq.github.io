  abstract  = {My PhD addresses the problem of detecting field failures with a new approach to test
               software systems under conditions that emerge only in production. Ex-vivo approaches detect
               field failures by executing the software system in the testbed with data extracted from the
               production environment. In-vivo approaches execute the available test suites in the production
               environment. We will define autonomic testing that detects conditions that emerge only in
               production scenarios, generates test cases for the new conditions, and executes the generated
               test cases in the new scenarios, to detect failures before they occur in production.},
